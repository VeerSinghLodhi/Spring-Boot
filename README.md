# Spring Boot Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my Spring Boot journey! This repository documents my learning, projects, and experiences with Spring Boot. Follow along as I explore various features, best practices, and real-world applications of this powerful framework.

## ðŸ“Œ What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is a Java-based framework that simplifies the development of stand-alone, production-ready Spring applications. It provides:
- Auto-configuration
- Embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.)
- Simplified dependency management
- Microservices support

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
### ðŸ”¹ Getting Started
- Setting up a Spring Boot project
- Understanding `@SpringBootApplication`
- Running a Spring Boot application

### ðŸ”¹ Spring Boot Annotations
- `@Controller` and `@RestController`
- `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`
- `@Autowired` and Dependency Injection
- `@Service` and `@Repository`

### ðŸ”¹ Building REST APIs
- Creating RESTful endpoints
- Handling request parameters and path variables
- JSON responses with `@ResponseBody`
- Exception handling with `@ControllerAdvice`

### ðŸ”¹ Database Integration
- Configuring Spring Boot with MySQL/PostgreSQL
- Using Spring Data JPA with Hibernate
- Performing CRUD operations

### ðŸ”¹ Security & Authentication
- Spring Security basics
- Implementing JWT authentication
- Role-based access control

### ðŸ”¹ Advanced Topics
- Microservices with Spring Boot
- Spring Boot with Docker
- Caching with Redis
- Message Queues (RabbitMQ/Kafka)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/VeerSinghLodhi/spring-boot.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
```
cd spring-boot
```

3. Build and run the application:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

4. Open your browser or use Postman to test endpoints:
```
http://localhost:8080/api/your-endpoint
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Build a full-fledged Spring Boot application
- Learn and implement microservices architecture
- Deploy Spring Boot applications to cloud platforms
